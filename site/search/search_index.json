That the Buddha meant his word when he delivered AN 4.42 is evidenced by his consistent application of the advice therein throughout the Canon (MN 63; MN 72; AN 10.95). As is suggested in the Pa\u00f1ha Sutta, the questions one asks are indications of what one takes to be worthwhile. Given that, according to the Buddha, what is ultimately worthwhile is the end of suffering, it was appropriate that he dismiss those questions which were detrimental or contrary to that aim. Why? Since such questions would have been founded in taking that as worthwhile which was contrary to what is actually worthwhile, according to the Buddha, by engaging such questions the Buddha would have been reinforcing misguided values and leading his questioners astray. </p> <pre><code> For those of us interested in Buddhism as a practice, not merely as an intellectual subject, it thus seems fitting that we apply such a framework for viewing questions to ourselves.

Nonetheless, it will be maintained that these forms are distinct, in the sense that they are not identical, while they remain highly interrelated (mundane right view begets transcendent right view, which begets final right view, etc.).</p> <p>In his treatise On the Path Ajaan Geoff (2017) lists three kinds of right view in the P\u0101li Canon:</p> <p>When the texts define conviction, they frame it as a matter of having conviction in the Buddha\u2019s awakening (\u00a755). In fact, the three levels of right view follow the pattern of the Buddha\u2019s three knowledges on the night of his awakening (\u00a730): Mundane right view accepts the content of the first two knowledges, on kamma and rebirth. Transcendent right view accepts the third knowledge, in which the Buddha\u2019s discovery of the four noble truths led to his awakening. The final level of right view, which lies beyond the transcendent, accepts a step that isn\u2019t mentioned in the standard description of the third knowledge, but which the Buddha elsewhere states was a crucial stage on the path: the total abandoning of the path itself. (pp. 113)</p> <p>However, I do not recall him claiming that this list is exhaustive; therefore, that an additional form of right view is included here does not in itself conflict with Ajaan Geoff's view as expressed above. Moreover, elsewhere he has intimated that the right view of one beyond training is distinct from the other forms of right view. It seems clear the final level of right view he describes pertains to the moments preceding the attainment of Arahantship:</p> <p>The final level of right view represents the stage when the path has done its work and the duties of the four noble truths collapse into one: Everything is to be regarded with dispassion and let go. (pp. 140)</p> <p>The canon infrequently, however, mentions one more kind of right view: the right view of one beyond training (asekh\u0101 sammadi\u1e6d\u1e6dhi).</p> <p>\"evameva kho, bhadd\u0101li, dasahi dhammehi samann\u0101gato bhikkhu \u0101huneyyo hoti p\u0101huneyyo dakkhi\u1e47eyyo a\u00f1jalikara\u1e47\u012byo anuttara\u1e43 pu\u00f1\u00f1akkhetta\u1e43 lokassa. katamehi dasahi? idha, bhadd\u0101li, bhikkhu asekh\u0101ya samm\u0101di\u1e6d\u1e6dhiy\u0101 samann\u0101gato hoti...</p> <p>Whether or not this is a distinct kind is a matter of controversy. Bhante Bodhi and Ajaan Geoff both in a series of articles about the question of not-self discussed the right view of one beyond training tangentially. Bhante Bodhi suggested that it refers to none other than transcendent right view, or knowledge of the four noble truths, while Ajaan Geoff suggested that it refers to a kind of right view that transcended even that.</p>"},{"location":"questions/sammaditthi/whether-there-are-distinct-kinds-of-right-view/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<ol> <li>Bhikkhu, \u1e6c.

That is to say, should it be interpreted as sequential, describing a sequence of events occurring in succession in time, or should it be interpreted as simultaneous, describing events occurring simultaneously in time? Though in the latter case, there might not be any temporal priority among the events, there might still be a causal, structural, or logical priority, just as, though the foundation of a building and its successive stories exist simultaneously, each preceding story is structurally prior to its successor,  every story ultimately being structurally grounded by the foundation. Thus, even if it is granted that the above excerpt describes simultaneous events, it might still be that those events stand in some relation to one another and are distinct.

Nonetheless, the inclusion of further discussion of other relevant discourses which comment differently on this matter will allow for a fuller understanding thereof. </p> <p>The first four prerequisites for living in seclusion are endowment with thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will, non-cruelty, and with wisdom. At AN 4.262 it is said that a monk endowed \"with thoughts of sensuality, with thoughts of ill will, with thoughts of harmfulness\" and who is \"a person of weak discernment... isn't fit to stay in isolated forest &amp; wilderness dwellings.\" However, a monk endowed \"with thoughts of renunciation, with thoughts of non-ill will, with thoughts of harmlessness\" and who \"is a discerning person... is fit to stay in isolated forest &amp; wilderness dwellings\" (AN 4.262, trans. \u1e6ch\u0101nissaro Bhikkhu; cf. DN 2; MN 4; MN 27; MN 38; MN 94; MN 101; AN 4.198). </p> <p>If it is assumed that the four latter and four former qualities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive<sup>1</sup>, then this discourse provides a list of both necessary and sufficient conditions for living in seclusion<sup>2</sup>.</p>"},{"location":"questions/viveka/whether-there-are-prerequisites-for-living-in-seclusion/#2-the-noble-aggregate-of-virtue-noble-sense-restraint-and-noble-mindfulness-and-clear-comprehension","title":"2. The noble aggregate of virtue, noble sense-restraint, and noble mindfulness and clear comprehension","text":"<p>The fifth, sixth, and seventh prerequisites for living in seclusion which are oft repeatedly implied in the Canonical description of the gradual training are the noble aggregate of moral discipline, noble sense-restraint, and noble virtue, respectively. For it is said:</p> <p>Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded dwelling\u2014a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. (DN 2, trans. Bhikkhu Bodhi) </p> <p>While this discourse doesn't explicitly state thus, it clearly implies that once one is endowed with the noble aggregate of virtue, noble sense-restraint, and noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, they are qualified to live in seclusion. It seems that these latter qualities are implied by the attainment of the qualities discussed in \u00a71; that is to say, endowment with thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will, non-cruelty, and with wisdom necessitate, at least generally among Buddhist disciples, endowment with virtue, sense-restraint, and mindfulness and clear comprehension. For, one without virtue, sense-restraint, mindfulness and clear comprehension does not attain purity of thought.</p>"},{"location":"questions/viveka/whether-there-are-prerequisites-for-living-in-seclusion/#3-samadhi","title":"3.
