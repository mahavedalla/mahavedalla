# Whether Nibbāna is a form of consciousness?

## Introduction

This is a controversial and as yet unresolved question among academics and monastics, and there are those who adamantly defend either that Nibbāna is or that it is not a form of consciousness. Because of this, no definite stance will be taken here. It is important outright to draw sharp distinction between this matter and another related one: Whether Nibbāna can be cognized? This article is strictly concerned with whether Nibbāna is itself a form of consciousness, not an object thereof. This is the distinction between eye and sight.

## Competing views

The monk Ajahn Brahmali, who has written one of the most rigorous contemporary papers on the nature of Nibbāna, adamantly denies that Nibbāna is a form of consciousness. In the abstract of said work, [<i>What the Nikāyas do and do not Say About Nibbāna</i>](#bibliography) Brahmali writes:

>...I will point out that the Nikāyas do not see Nibbāna as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as anidassana viññāṇa and appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa (Brahmali, 2009)

Also appearing to reject that Nibbāna is a form of consciousness is Ñāṇavīra Thera [(1960-65)](#bibliography). Since he appears to adopt a cessationistic view of Nibbāna in his infamous <i>Notes on Dhamma</i>, it is assumed here that he denies that Nibbāna is a form of consciousness a fortiori (if it isn't anything at all, but a mere cessation, then it is certainly not a form of consciousness).
