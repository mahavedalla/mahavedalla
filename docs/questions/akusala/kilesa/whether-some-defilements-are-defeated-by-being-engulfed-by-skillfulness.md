# Whether some defilements are engulfed by skillfulness?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

As in, are some defilements ended, not through deliberate attention, but simply through one developing on the path and said defilement being "engulfed" as it were or just consumed by one's broad skillfulness, again, not through being directly combatted.
