# Whether the noble eightfold path is the ultimate end?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems the path is the ultimate end, for it is said that "right view is the far shore" (AN 10.117), along with all of the other factors of the tenfold path. Since the far shore is an epithet of Nibbāna, therefore, the path, as in the noble eight or tenfold path, is the ultimate end of the holy life.

On the contrary, it is said that the noble eightfold path is the highest of all *conditioned* phenomena, and that the noble eightfold path, like a makeshift raft, should be abandoned once it has been used to successfully reach the far shore.

I answer that for various reasons the path cannot be identified with Nibbāna. Not only is the path conditioned, but the duty with respect of the path is to develop it, while the duty with respect to Nibbāna is to realize it. Moreover, it is said that the path and factors therein arise and cease, which is not characteristic of Nibbāna.

Reply to Objection 1: What is said in that sutta should not be taken as a strict identification of the path with Nibbāna. Rather, insofar as the attainment of the path unfailingly leads to the far shore, as it were, it may be called the far shore, just as if one were to finally arrive at the final stretch of their journey to some destination, they might say "I have arrived".
