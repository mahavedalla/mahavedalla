# Whether bahussuta and pariyatti are the same?

## Introduction

According to the Canon, in the regards to Dhamma-Vināya, there is evidence that "bahussuta" (much learning) and "pariyatti" (mastery) are the same, since they are cases where they are used interchangeably. For, it is said:

>Furthermore, a mendicant who wants to accuse another should check this: ‘Am I very learned [bahussuto], remembering and keeping what I’ve learned? These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. Am I very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically? Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, memorize [pariyāpuṇassū] the scriptures first.’ (AN 10.44, trans. Sujato) <!-- proper citation -->

That "bahussuta" and "pariyatti" (in it's verbal form "pariyāpuṇāti") are used thus suggests that they are the same, in regards to the Dhamma-Vināya. However, this evidence is defeasible, nor does it necessarily apply to the usage of these terms outside of Dhamma-Vināya (though this is thus beyond the scope of this article, and thus irrelevant). However, outside of Dhamma-Vināya, "bahussuta" seems to be used in a more general sense to refer to someone who is learned not necessarily in the Dhamma-Vināya specifically.<!-- citation -->
