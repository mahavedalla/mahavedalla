# Whether the path involves bodily development?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems the noble eightfold path does not involve bodily development, for it is said in many ways that the body is a boil, disease, and affliction, and moreover the path culminates in the final abandonment of the body. Therefore, the path does not involve bodily development.

Objection 2: In the one place in the Canon where weight training is mentioned, the Buddha is tacitly critical thereof; therefore, the path does not involve bodily development. Moreover, it is to be frequently recollected that food is not to be eaten for fattening or putting on bulk or beautification. Therefore, the path does not involve bodily development.

On the contrary, it was said by the Buddha that “What you have just spoken of as development of body, Aggivessana, is not development of body according to the Dhamma in the Noble One’s Discipline....as to how one is undeveloped...and developed in body...listen and attend closely to what I shall say...".

I answer that insofar as living beings have bodies which may or may not serve them in the development of the path, the path involves bodily development. The aggregate of virtue specifically concerns the development of bodily and verbal conduct, the latter pertaining to the body in the broad sense insofar as speech is mediated by the body. While the pleasure of the first three jhānas is said not to be sensual, pleasure born of seclusion, concentration, and equanimity are nonetheless said to permeate the body. Moreover, it is part of the development of concentration that, like a bathman or bathman's apprentice, the noble disciple learns to permeate the body with the aforesaid pleasure. 

Reply to Objection 1: At the culmination of the path, even the path itself is abandoned. Therefore, supposing we should not thereby conclude that the path does not involve the path, nor should we conclude that the path neither involves bodily development.

Reply to Objection 2: This objection presumes that bodily development is the hypertrophy of contractile tissue or in some other fashion pertaining to sports, athletics, or suchlike. However, said activities do not exhaust bodily development, even in the world, let alone the discipline of the Noble One.
