# Whether suffering is essential to conscience and compunction?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Hiri and otappa are two fundamental qualities in the Dhamma, which I've rendered as conscience and compunction. Some go for shame and fear. There isn't an adequate translation into English without a footnote. It seems to me that otappa might be akin to the fear of God found in Christianity and particularly the Desert Fathers. We want a translation which captures what these qualities are like, without making them sound unhealthy or negative. Shame and fear without qualification border on the latter. In any case, the question arises whether for these qualities to function they must involve some form of suffering, like ordinary regret or shame typically do. If so, how does this fit with the general aim of bringing suffering to an end. Is there a tension?

I'm inclined to think these qualities needn't rely on suffering as a kind of whip to force the submission of the individual. Even if they do, it isn't clear why this must conflict with the broader project of the destruction of suffering. This seems akin to the paradox of desire. That some suffering might be a useful instrument along the path (love and desire for the path, maybe conscience and compunction if we think suffering must be involved), doesn't entail any strict contradiction with the aim of ending all suffering, nor does it seem to cause a tension with that aim. Why? It just simply is the case that in pursuing certain aims, one must act in ways that seem directly contrary to it. Vaccination involves the introduction of the very virus or disease that we are trying to eliminate into the patient. Overcoming addiction might involve finding a less harmful substance or object to be addicted to. Taking a space ship into space involves very heavy fuel that is necessary get it out of earth's gravitational pull. 

That being said, if we want to claim that suffering is always and everywhere gratuitous, then it looks like there might be more trouble for the view that hiri and otappa involve suffering.
