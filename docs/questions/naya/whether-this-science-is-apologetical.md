# Whether this science is apologetical?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems this science is apologetical, for it is said that debate is appropriate to this science, but religious is about defending and asserting doctrines; therefore, this science is apologetical.

On the contrary, I answer that apologetics, as normally conceived, is the activity of presupposing the truth of a doctrine, and then subsequently finding rational means to defend and assert it. However, this science does not presuppose any doctrine which should not be presupposed, and then subsequently find rational means to defend and assert it; rather, it aims provisionally to express the Dhamma-Vināya of the Buddha Gotama as rationally as possible, for the aim of finding a true Dhamma-Vināya, for the ultimate aim of Nibbāna.
