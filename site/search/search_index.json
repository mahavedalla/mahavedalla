It is the conjunction of \"mah\u0101\", meaning great, and \"vedalla\", which literally means \"to be split apart\", but has the sense of \"question and answer\" or \"catechism\"; and thus, \"Mah\u0101vedalla\" is naturally rendered as \"The Great Q&amp;A\".</p> <p>Q: What is the Mah\u0101vedalla project?</p> <p>The Mah\u0101vedalla project is dedicated to systematically asking and answering, as far as is possible, every and all relevant questions about the doctrine and discipline of the P\u0101li Canon, particularly the Nik\u0101yas, Vin\u0101ya, and the other early texts therein. It does so in a question and answer, or catechetical, format.</p> <p>Q: What is the purpose of the Mah\u0101vedalla?</p> <p>The primary purpose of the Mah\u0101vedalla project is to provide convenient access to information about the doctrine and discipline of the P\u0101li Canon for all those who are interested, at any stage in their understanding. This ought to be especially useful as an instruction manual or catechism for those unfamiliar with the Canon (new practitioners or non-Buddhists looking to learn more). It also ought to be useful for those who are familiar but who lack a convenient, organized, and concise repository of information about the Canon for reference.</p> <p>Q: How did the Mah\u0101vedalla begin?</p> <p>This project began as more or less a personal repository for the author to record the questions and subsequent answers that arose for them in their study of the Canon, in their attempt to flesh out and penetrate its contents. </p> <p>Q: What is unique about the Mah\u0101vedalla?</p>"},{"location":"other/methodology/","title":"Methodology","text":""},{"location":"other/support/","title":"Support","text":""},{"location":"other/support/#1-posing-questions","title":"1.

Practical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality involves time and sensual pleasures cost money which are better spent elsewhere)</p> <p>Let us examine each family and its constituents in turn.</p>"},{"location":"questions/kama/what-are-the-drawbacks-of-sensuality/#1-mental-drawbacks","title":"1. Mental Drawbacks","text":"<p>The foremost drawback of sensuality is that it causes suffering to those afflicted by it. This drawback can be divided into three distinct, though related, drawbacks: (1.1) the inevitable suffering that results when sensual craving is frustrated; (1.2) the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving; (1.3) the unsatisfactoriness of sensual pleasures.</p> <p>Let us examine each in turn.</p> <p>1.1  The suffering of frustrated sensual craving</p> <p>The first mental drawback of sensuality is the suffering of frustrated sensual craving. Inevitably, for those afflicted by sensual craving, suffering, in various different forms\u2014e.g., dissatisfaction, sorrow, grief, anger, anxiety\u2014will arise when their sensual craving is frustrated, that is, for whatever reason, not satisfied. This commonly occurs when one's access to the objects of their sensual craving is frustrated; for instance, when one loses a loved one to death, or one's most precious possessions are stolen or destroyed, or they eat food that disagrees with them, or, inevitably, one must face death, and thus separation from all that is beloved to them. For, in SN 22.2, it is said:</p> <p>\"There are, friends, wise khattiyas, wise brahmins, wise househoulders, and wise ascetics who question a bhikkhu when he has gone abroad\u2014for wise people, friends, are inquisitive: 'What does your teacher say, what does he teach?' Being asked thus, friends, you should answer: 'Our teacher, friends, teaches the removal of desire and lust.'\\ \"When you have answered thus, friends, there may be wise khattiyas ... wise ascetics who will question you further\u2014for wise people, friends, are inquisitive: 'In regard to what does your teacher teach the removal of desire and lust?' Being asked thus, friends, you should answer: 'Our teacher, friends, teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness.'\\ \"When you have answered thus, friends, there may be wise khattiyas, wise ascetics who will question you further\u2014for wise people, friends, are inquisitve: 'Having seen what danger does your teacher teach the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness?' Being asked thus, friends, you should answer thus: 'If, friends, one is not devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving in regard to form, then with the change and alteration of form there arise in one sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. If, friends, one is not devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving in regard to feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, then with the change and alteration of consciousness there arise in one sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Having seen this danger, our teacher teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness.'</p> <p>However, on the other hand, for those unafflicted by sensual craving, suffering, to that extent, will not arise. For, the same discourse continues:</p> <p>If one is devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving in regarding to feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, then with the change and alteration of consciousness sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair do not arise in one. Having seen this benefit, our teacher teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness.' (SN 22.??)</p> <p>Thus, the first mental drawback of sensual craving is the suffering of frustrated sensual craving.</p>"},{"location":"questions/kama/what-are-the-drawbacks-of-sensuality/#12-the-suffering-inherent-in-the-experience-of-sensual-craving","title":"1.2 The suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving","text":"<p>The second mental drawback of sensuality is the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving. According to the Canon, sensual craving is a disease of the mind as leprosy is a disease to the body. Namely, sensual craving overwhelms the mind with dissatisfaction, and consequently various secondary forms of suffering\u2014e.g.,sorrow, grief, anger, anxiety\u2014that then must be appeased, though not uprooted, through indulgence in the objects the sensual craving directs, as if through coercion, the mind towards. Appeasing this sensual craving by indulging it results in a measure of gratification (largely just relief from the craving itself), though sensual craving remains fundamentally suffering, a disease of mind. Moreover, it is often this appeasement that that excacerbates the sensual craving itself, nor can it actually uproot or eliminate the craving. For, in MN 75 it is said:</p> <p>\"Suppose, M\u0101gandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit. What do you think, M\u0101gandiya? Would that man twist his body this way and that?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, hot, and scorching.\" \"What do you think, M\u0101gandiya? Is it only now that that fire is painful to touch, hot, and scorching, or previously too was that fire painful to touch, hot, and scorching?\"</p> <p>\"Master Gotama, that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching. For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired; thus, though the fire was actually painful to touch, he acquired a mistaken perception of it as pleasant.\"</p> <p>\"So too, M\u0101gandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch, hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and scorching. But these beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant.\" </p> <p>\"Suppose, M\u0101gandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit; the more he scratches the scabs and cauterises his body, the fouler, more evil-smelling and more infected the openings of his wounds would become, yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of his wounds. So too, M\u0101gandiya, beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, still indulge in sensual pleasures; the more such beings indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned by their fever for sensual pleasures, yet they find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasure.\"</p> <p>This example in particular illustrates the Buddha's mastery of the use of simile.</p> <p>Thus, the second mental drawback of sensual craving is the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving.</p> <p>1.3 The unsatisfactoriness of sensual pleasures</p> <p>The third mental drawback of sensual craving is the unsatisfactoriness of sensual pleasures. Despite their often irresistible seductive charm, sensual pleasures afford a trifling and ephemeral gratification that doesn't ultimately satisfy.</p>"},{"location":"questions/kama/what-are-the-drawbacks-of-sensuality/#2-obstructive-drawbacks","title":"2.

Category: Pa\u00f1ha Sutta References: AN 4.42 Tags: Questions, Worthwhile Last Updated: May 2, 2025 Date Entered: May 2, 2025 Review Status: In progress Role: Essential</p> <p>It seems to me that the question of questions, that is, what questions should be answered and how, is fundamental both to the practice and the object of this particular project, which is to answer questions. That the Buddha meant his word when he delivered AN 4.42 is evidenced by his consistent application of the advice therein throughout the Canon (MN 63; MN 72; AN 10.95). As is suggested in the Pa\u00f1ha Sutta, the questions one asks are indications of what one takes to be worthwhile. Given that, according to the Buddha, what is ultimately worthwhile is the end of suffering, it was appropriate that he dismiss those questions which were detrimental or contrary to that aim. Why? Since such questions would have been founded in taking that as worthwhile which was contrary to what is actually worthwhile, according to the Buddha, by engaging such questions the Buddha would have been reinforcing misguided values and leading his questioners astray. </p> <pre><code> For those of us interested in Buddhism as a practice, not merely as an intellectual subject, it thus seems fitting that we apply such a framework for viewing questions to ourselves. Given that this project has been undertaken from the perspective of practice, such a framework will also be applied to it.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"questions/panna/what-is-wisdom/","title":"What is wisdom?","text":"<p>In Brief:</p> <p>Wisdom (or discernment), pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, is knowledge of the four noble truths.</p> <p>In Full:</p> <p>Wisdom (or discerment), pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, is knowledge of the four noble truths.

Nonetheless, it will be maintained that these forms are distinct, in the sense that they are not identical, while they remain highly interrelated (mundane right view begets transcendent right view, which begets final right view, etc.).</p> <p>In his treatise On the Path Ajaan Geoff (2017) lists three kinds of right view in the P\u0101li Canon:</p> <p>When the texts define conviction, they frame it as a matter of having conviction in the Buddha\u2019s awakening (\u00a755). In fact, the three levels of right view follow the pattern of the Buddha\u2019s three knowledges on the night of his awakening (\u00a730): Mundane right view accepts the content of the first two knowledges, on kamma and rebirth. Transcendent right view accepts the third knowledge, in which the Buddha\u2019s discovery of the four noble truths led to his awakening. The final level of right view, which lies beyond the transcendent, accepts a step that isn\u2019t mentioned in the standard description of the third knowledge, but which the Buddha elsewhere states was a crucial stage on the path: the total abandoning of the path itself. (pp. 113)</p> <p>However, I do not recall him claiming that this list is exhaustive; therefore, that an additional form of right view is included here does not in itself conflict with Ajaan Geoff's view as expressed above. Moreover, elsewhere he has intimated that the right of one beyond training is distinct from the other forms of right view. It seems clear the final level of right view he describes pertains to the moments preceding the attainment of Arahantship:</p> <p>The final level of right view represents the stage when the path has done its work and the duties of the four noble truths collapse into one: Everything is to be regarded with dispassion and let go.

That is to say, should it be interpreted as sequential, describing a sequence of events occurring in succession in time, or should it be interpreted as simultaneous, describing events occurring simultaneously in time? Though in the latter case, there might not be any temporal priority among the events, there might still be a causal, structural, or logical priority, just as, though the foundation of a building and its successive stories exist simultaneously, each preceding story is structurally prior to its successor,  every story ultimately being structurally grounded by the foundation. Thus, even if it is granted that the above excerpt describes simultaneous events, it might still be that those events stand in some relation to one another and are distinct. It seems plausible that the quote should be taken literally, and thus that dispassion is a proximate step in the attainment of Nibb\u0101na, and thus not identical to it, though nonetheless closely related and indispensable to it.\n</code></pre> <p>Another relevant stock description:</p> <p>Tassa mayha\u1e41, bhikkhave, etadahosi: \u2018n\u0101ya\u1e41 dhammo nibbid\u0101ya na vir\u0101g\u0101ya na nirodh\u0101ya na upasam\u0101ya na abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya na sambodh\u0101ya na nibb\u0101n\u0101ya sa\u1e41vattati</p> <p>\u2018This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na\u2026(MN 26; Bodhi)</p> <p>It seems this quote might more or less settle the issue:</p> <p>Yampissa ta\u1e41, bhikkhave, khayasmi\u1e41 khaye \u00f1\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41, tampi saupanisa\u1e41 vad\u0101mi, no anupanisa\u1e41.
