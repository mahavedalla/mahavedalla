# Whether debate is appropriate to doctrinal study?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems that debate is not appropriate to this science, for the Buddha in many ways criticized debate as being not only unbeneficial but harmful.

Objection 2: Moreover, this science has as its ultimate end Nibbāna, yet debate is beset by many unskillful states, such as divisiveness, conceit, and competitiveness, which must be abandoned for Nibbāna to be realized (AN 10.101??).

On the contrary, the Buddha says various times that both the ability to refute other doctrines and debate are appropriate occasionally. Moreover, our interlocutor, in the spirit of debate, asserts that debate is not appropriate to this science, and thus undermines their own position in the act of asserting it.

I answer that debate, conceived as the mutual exchange of differing opinions about important matters, is appropriate.

Reply to Objection 1: I grant that in many ways the Buddha criticized particular debates and kinds of debate; however, I do not grant that the Buddha criticized debate as such. The Buddha criticized those debates and kinds of debate, such as those wherein the parties are motivated by dogmatism, conceit, competitiveness, bad faith, and other unskillful states, which were deserving of criticism, though he didn't do so one-sidedly. As he said many times, there are occasions where debate is appropriate.

Reply to Objection 2: This objection too fails to distinguish the activity, debate, from the unskillful states. I grant that debate may be often beset by the aforesaid unskillful states, but that doesn't mean debate itself is unskillful, nor that it cannot be practiced without those unskillful states. Views themselves are a basis for those aforesaid unskillful states, yet right view is not unskillful itself, and is actually fundamental to the path. Whatever debate leads to the growth of unskillful states, that debate is inappropriate, and should not be pursued; however, whatever debate leads to the growth of skillful states, that debate is appropriate, and should be pursued.
