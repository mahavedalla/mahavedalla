# Whether Nibbāna is a cognizable object?

## Introduction

This is a controversial and as yet unresolved question among academics and monastics, and there are those who adamantly defend either that Nibbāna is or that it cannot be cognized Because of this, no definite stance will be taken here. It is important outright to draw sharp distinction between this matter and another related one: Whether Nibbāna is a form of consciousness? This article is strictly concerned with whether Nibbāna can be cognized, as a sight can be cognized.

## Competing views

Brahmali (2009) adamantly denies that Nibbāna can be cognized: "There is no indication that Nibbāna is an ‘existing entity’ which is taken as a direct object of consciousness." As discussed in the article <i>Whether Nibbāna is a form of consciousness?</i>, it is assumed that Ñāṇavīra maintains a cessationistic view, and thus a fortiori denies that Nibbāna can be cognized, though he doesn't appear to explicitly state as much.

On the other hand, Brahmali writes of Bhikkhu Bodhi:
>In his translation and explanation of the Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha, in which he refers extensively to the above mentioned ṭīkā, Bodhi (1993, 363) states that: ‘the attainment of fruition (phalasamāpatti) is a meditative attainment by which a noble disciple enters into supramundane absorption with Nibbāna as object’.
Bhikkhu Bodhi has elsewhere consistently defended an unconditionalist view of Nibbāna. In a relatively recent interview with Daniel Aitken, he seems to more or less adopt the same view (Aitken, 2025).
