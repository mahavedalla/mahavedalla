Notes:

Bhikkhu Brahmali suggests that citing prose in such cases is at least not great:

>Secondly, Pali verse is notoriously difficult to translate: the correct Pali reading is often difficult to establish and poetic licence etc. can complicate matters further. Moreover, as in poetry in general, the exact meaning of Pali verse is often vague as its emphasis is on appealing to emotion and intuition rather than on making precise doctrinal statements. Finally, Pali verse often contains rare words and phrases that sometimes occur nowhere else in the tipiṭaka.

Bhikkhu Bodhi also takes a similar stance:

>As a general rule, to uncover the doctrinal positions of the early texts, we are on more secure ground when we rely on the prose suttas, which aim at lucid exposition rather than poetic suggestion. The prose texts make it plain that the Buddha and the arahants affirm the clear distinction between right view and wrong view and repeatedly insist that we should equip ourselves with the former and reject the latter.

Ajaan Geoff seems to take the affirmative stance, however:

>Secondly, the prose passages of the Canon never suggest that the poems recorded in the Canon are to be dismissed as “only suggestive.” On the contrary, several prose passages are devoted to ferreting out the meaning of verses that they treat as particularly profound. (See, for example, SN 22:3, AN 3:32, AN 3:33, AN 4:41, and AN 6:61.) In AN 4:231, the Buddha distinguishes among four kinds of poets, one of them being the meaning-poet. Although he doesn’t define any of the four, the implication is that he himself was a meaning-poet, one whose verses had meaning and were not to be dismissed, in the words of AN 2:46, as being merely “elegant in sound and elegant in rhetoric.” Given that the Buddha and the compilers of the Canon took their poetry seriously, it’s an act of scholarly arrogance for modern interpreters to dismiss that poetry simply because its message lies outside the categories of our own thought and language. This is especially true in the case of a teaching, like the Buddha’s, whose whole point lies beyond the boundaries of description.
