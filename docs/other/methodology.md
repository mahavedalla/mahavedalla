# Methodology

## Introduction

This article is concerned with second-order questions about Dhamma-Vināya; namely, what principles should be adhered to in the study of the Dhamma-Vināya. 

At present, entries are written in a highly standardized and organized format to improve clarity and readability (at the expense of enjoyability), as well as to lighten the task of future translation, if it is ever undertaken. 

## 1. Lone discourses

As it is said of other religious texts, such as the Bible, one can read into the Canon any particular view they wish to maintain. It is for this reason that it seems useful to delineate some basic criteria for how the Canon is to be interpreted to curtail false attributions to it. Often times, one discourse in isolation, without reference to other discourses or other context, can be wielded to reach some desideratum<!-- examples -->. It seems incorrect, however, to say then that to cite one discourse is wholly inadequate when settling matters of Dhamma. For, there are unique discourses which comment on a particular issue that no others do. And, in those cases, we do not want to reject the conclusions that can be drawn from them, merely because they can find no other support in the Canon. It seems reasonable to accept what conclusions can be derived from those discourses, but to some extent. If the discourse comments uniquely on a truly niche issue, then it seems reasonable to accept what conclusions can be derived from it only defeasibly. If the discourse comments uniquely on an issue fundamental to the broader network of understanding of the Dhamma, then it might be accepted with more fixity.

This can also be understood in epistemic terms. How should we update our beliefs about the Canon when we encounter new material therein? This is contrasted with the above discussion, because we may encounter a discourse that touches on an issue in a way no other discourse that we know of does, while there actually remain other discourses that touch on the same issue that we do not yet know. In such cases, it seems prudent to accept what conclusions can be derived from such a discourse defeasibly.

2. Unanswered questions

In his teaching career, the Buddha often left many questions unanswered, particularly those of a speculative kind. This project is undertaken respecting the Buddha's reluctance to answer such questions.
