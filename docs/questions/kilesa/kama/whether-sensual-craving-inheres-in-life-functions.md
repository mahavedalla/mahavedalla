Notes:

One potential worry is that some people might think that craving is an inherent part of particularly bodily existence, rendering the goal unattainable insofar as one has a physical body. For instance, isn't hunger unavoidable? Thirst? The desire for sleep? My inclination is to simply say something like this: we often crave in regard to those bodily functions, but the craving isn't inherent to them, and while those bodily functions are inherent to bodily existence, they are not themselves the problem. Then again, someone might actually just accept that craving inheres in the body, but that this only means the goal is reached totally at death. I think this view has problems, but it is a way someone could go.
