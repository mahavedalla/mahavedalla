<b>Q: What does Mahāvedalla mean?</b>

"Mahāvedalla" (pronounced muh-haw-vay-duh-luh) is a Pāli term and is the name of the forty-third discourse of the Majjhima Nikāya. It is the conjunction of "mahā", meaning great, and "vedalla", which literally means "to be split apart", but has the sense of "question and answer" or "catechism"; and thus, "Mahāvedalla" is naturally rendered as "The Great Q&A".

<b>Q: What is the Mahāvedalla project?</b>

The Mahāvedalla project is dedicated to systematically asking and answering, as far as is possible, every and all relevant questions about the doctrine and discipline of the Pāli Canon, particularly the Nikāyas, Vināya, and the other early texts therein. It does so in a question and answer, or catechetical, format.

<b>Q: What is the purpose of the Mahāvedalla?</b>

The primary purpose of the Mahāvedalla project is to provide convenient access to information about the doctrine and discipline of the Pāli Canon for all those who are interested, at any stage in their understanding. This ought to be especially useful as an instruction manual or catechism for those unfamiliar with the Canon (new practitioners or non-Buddhists looking to learn more). It also ought to be useful for those who are familiar but who lack a convenient, organized, and concise repository of information about the Canon for reference.

<b>Q: How did the Mahāvedalla begin?</b>

This project began as more or less a personal repository for the author to record the questions and subsequent answers that arose for them in their study of the Canon, in their attempt to flesh out and penetrate its contents. 

<b>Q: What is unique about the Mahāvedalla?</b>
