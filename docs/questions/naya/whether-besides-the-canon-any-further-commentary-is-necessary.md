# Whether, besides the Canon, any further commentary is necessary?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems that, besides the Canon, no further science is needed, for it said "the Dhamma is well-expounded" (citation), thus, no further science is needed.

Objection 2: Moreover, the Buddha was the foremost among Buddhas in expounding the Dhamma, let alone among those who aren't Buddhas. So, no one could be more qualified than him to expound the Dhamma, and therefore, besides the suttas, no further science is necessary.
