# What is learning?

## Introduction

Learning in the Canon refers to the learning of the Dhamma teachings taught by the Buddha. For it is frequently said:

>Here, monks, a certain person learns the Dhamma—the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers..." (my own translation)

>idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo dhammaṃ <i>pariyāpuṇāti</i> – suttaṃ, geyyaṃ, veyyākaraṇaṃ, gāthaṃ, udānaṃ, itivuttakaṃ, jātakaṃ, abbhutadhammaṃ, vedallaṃ. (AN 4.102; Cf. AN 4.103; AN 4.107; AN 4.108; AN 4.186; AN 4.191; AN 4.192; AN 5.73; AN 5.74; AN 5.75; AN 5.155; italics added)

"Pariyatti" is the cognate noun of the verb "pariyāpuṇāti" (think pariyāpuṇāti'tion, like "determines" and "determination"), which Bhante Bodhi translates as "masters". Without taking issue with his translation, in this context it clearly implies learning the Dhamma teachings, and which is equally well translated as ".

Notes:

This rather simple subject is actually somewhat challenging. There are other words in the Canon which are relevent besides pariyatti, like suta. It seems to me also that pariyatti is not just learning, but learnedness, or scholarship, that is to say, it is learning well or becoming learned of the Dhamma teachings, mastering them. 

An attempt at Pali:

"Learning" in the Canon is the learning of the Dhamma teachings taught by the Buddha. For it is frequently said:

"Suta"ti pāliyaṃ buddhena desitānaṃ dhammadesanānāṃ sutaṃ hoti. Evamhi bahulaṃ vuttaṃ: 
idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo dhammaṃ <i>pariyāpuṇāti</i> – suttaṃ, geyyaṃ, veyyākaraṇaṃ, gāthaṃ, udānaṃ, itivuttakaṃ, jātakaṃ, abbhutadhammaṃ, vedallaṃ.
