# Whether a sufficient distinction can be drawn between ordinary function and desire?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

An interesting illustration that there is a distinction is at MN 75. The Buddha heavily critiques sensuality "kāma", yet in the same discourse also describes someone freed from sensuality as "yena kāmaṃ gamo", which I render as "going wherever he desires".
