# Whether jhāna is necessary to be qualified to live in seclusion?

## Introduction

According to the Canon, there is strong evidence that the attainment of jhāna is not necessary to live in seclusion. That the attainment of jhāna is not necessary to live in seclusion can be known in at least one way.

1. Implicit statements
<!-- 2. Canonical examples? -->

Let us examine each way in turn.

## 1. Implicit statements

At DN 2 it is said:

>Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded dwelling—a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. ([DN 2, trans. Bhikkhu Bodhi](#bibliography))

This discourse implies that once one is endowed with the noble aggregate of virtue, noble sense-restraint, and noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, they are qualified to live in seclusion. Moreover, that this statement is repeated exactly or in like form numerous times throughout the Canon (cf. DN 10, MN 107, MN 125) suggests that it is generalizable, that is to say, that it can be applied disciples generally.
