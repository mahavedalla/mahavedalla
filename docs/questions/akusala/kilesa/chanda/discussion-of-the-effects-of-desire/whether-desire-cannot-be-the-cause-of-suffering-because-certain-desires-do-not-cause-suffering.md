# Whether desire cannot be the cause of suffering because certain desires do not cause suffering?

## Bibliography

Notes:

Objection: It seems desire cannot be the cause of suffering, for surely one's desire to perform many activities in itself does not cause suffering, such as the desire to consume physical nutriment, to open a door, to meditate, to stretch one's limbs; therefore, since these desires do not cause suffering, desire cannot always cause of suffering, and thus is not itself the cause of suffering.

On the contrary, while this objection rightly points out that said "desires" do not in themselves cause suffering, it equivocates on different meanings of the word "desire" when it concludes that therefore desire is not itself the cause of suffering. "Desire" with respect to suffering, stress, and the manifold other mental diseases, the path, and its fruit, does not include such ordinary "desires" in themselves as the "desire" to walk, eat, talk, stretch, meditate, etc.; therefore, this objection does not succeed.

I answer that the word "desire" is too broad in scope and has many nuances, and thus needs to be disambiguated to avoid the aforementioned issue. "Desire" with respect to the aforementioned activities is itself just an inclination of the will determined by a complex structure of values; thus when a man desires to eat his breakfast, his will is inclined to eat breakfast, by dint of his value of satiety, health, and so forth.
