# Whether this science is identical to commentary?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems this science is commentarial, for its primary object is the suttas and clarifying their meaning, which is just the primary object of commentary.

On the contrary, I answer that a discipline is distinguished not only by the object with which it engages, but, among other things, by the reason and method and provisional aims by which it engages therewith. Just as the architect and carpenter might both be concerned with the same building, they are hardly identical, for the carpenter's job is to build the building, while the architects to design it, though both aim for the ultimate construction of the building. This science is indeed concerned, broadly, with clarifying the meaning of the suttas; however, this neglects that its primary object is not the clarification, line by line, of any particular sutta or body of suttas, but the rigorous clarification of the doctrine which may be found within, and inferred from, the suttas at large, and thus its scope and provisional aim is different.
