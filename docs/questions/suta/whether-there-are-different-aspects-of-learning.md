# Whether there are different aspects of learning?

## Introduction

According to the Canon, there are at least four different aspects of learning:

1. Retention
2. Verbal recitation
3. Mental Recollection
4. Penetration by view

For, it is said:

>‘Am I very learned [bahussuto], remembering and keeping what I’ve learned? These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. Am I very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically?
