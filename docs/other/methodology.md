<!-- Section: Hermeneutics -->
<!-- Discuss the principles which determine how the Canon is interpreted. E.g., is it sufficient to draw a conclusion about something based on one source in the Canon? If so, in what cases? To what extent? The four kinds of questions -->

<!-- This project is currently intended to be descriptive and neutral with respect to matters of doctrine and discipline which are disputed; however, where there is no dispute and/or where, despite dispute, the Canon is clear, a clear stance will be taken. -->
# Methodology

At present, entries are written in a highly standardized and organized format to improve clarity and readability (at the expense of enjoyability), as well as to lighten the task of future translation, if it is ever undertaken
