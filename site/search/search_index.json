It is the conjunction of \"mah\u0101\", meaning great, and \"vedalla\", which literally means \"to be split apart\", but has the sense of \"question and answer\" or \"catechism\"; and thus, \"Mah\u0101vedalla\" is naturally rendered as \"The Great Q&amp;A\".</p> <p>Q: What is the Mah\u0101vedalla project?</p> <p>The Mah\u0101vedalla project is dedicated to systematically asking and answering, as far as is possible, every and all relevant questions about the doctrine and discipline of the P\u0101li Canon, particularly the Nik\u0101yas, Vin\u0101ya, and the other early texts therein. It does so in a question and answer, or catechetical, format.</p> <p>Q: What is the purpose of the Mah\u0101vedalla?</p> <p>The primary purpose of the Mah\u0101vedalla project is to provide convenient access to information about the doctrine and discipline of the P\u0101li Canon for all those who are interested, at any stage in their understanding.</p> <p>Q: How did the Mah\u0101vedalla begin?</p> <p>This project began as more or less a personal repository for the author to record the questions and subsequent answers that arose for them in their study of the Canon, in their attempt to flesh out and penetrate its contents. </p> <p>Q: What is unique about the Mah\u0101vedalla?</p> <p>The Mah\u0101vedalla is unique primarily in one respect: (1) Unlike in other religions, particularly Catholicism, where there is a strong catechetical tradition to initiate neophytes and to comprehensively spell out the Church's doctrine and discipline for all interested, the author has not found a satisfactory parallel for the doctrine and discipline of the Canon. The Mah\u0101vedalla is an attempt to provide a satisfactory parallel, so that all interested may have convenient access to all relevant points of doctrine and discipline in the Canon. </p>"},{"location":"other/methodology/","title":"Methodology","text":""},{"location":"other/support/","title":"Support","text":""},{"location":"other/support/#how-to-support-the-mahavedalla-project","title":"How to support the Mah\u0101vedalla project.","text":"<p>(1) Asking Questions: Asking questions relevant to the doctrine and discipline of the Canon that are not yet in the project.</p> <p>(2) Curation: vetting, revising, updating, etc., answers to questions.</p> <p>(3) Answering Questions: answering unanswered questions in the project.</p> <p>(4) Metadata: adding metadata to questions     - Sutta references, commentarial references, Dhamma talks, articles, books, etc..</p> <p>(5) Translation: translating entries into whatever non-English language you are literate in.</p> <p>(6) Development: Upgrading and expanding the digital format of the Mah\u0101vedalla     - iOS and Android app     - Smart search system     - making a PDF         - making an introduction to dhammavinaya/catechism using part of the project</p> <p>(7) Other: anything else which might be useful</p>"},{"location":"questions/nibbana/whether-nibbana-is-a-substance/","title":"Whether nibbana is a substance","text":"<p>Is it?</p>"}]}
