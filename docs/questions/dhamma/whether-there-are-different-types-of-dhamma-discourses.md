# Whether there are different types of Dhamma discourses?

Yes. There are different types of Dhamma discourses. Namely:

1. discourses (suttaṃ)
2. mixed verse (geyyaṃ)
3. expositions (veyyākaraṇaṃ)
4. verses (gāthaṃ)
5. exhortations (udānaṃ)
6. quotes <!-- "thus said" is an unsatisfactory, though literal translation; I guess "what was heard" or "quotes" or "accounts" or "recounts" might be more fitting -->(itivuttakaṃ)
7. birth tales (jātakaṃ)
8. marvelous stories (abbhutadhammaṃ)
9. questions & answers (vedalla)
