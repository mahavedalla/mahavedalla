# What is bahussuta?

## Introduction

According to the Canon, "bahussuta" (lit. "much learning" or "one who is very learned") is consistently defined as someone who is very learned in the Dhamma-Vināya. For it is frequently said: 

>...a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, rehearsing them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. (DN 33, trans. Bhikkhu Sujato; cf. DN 34, MN 32, AN 10.17, AN 10.44, AN 10.50, AN 11.14)
