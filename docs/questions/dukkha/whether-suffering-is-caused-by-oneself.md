# Whether suffering is caused by oneself?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Surprisingly, when asked this question point blank the Buddha refuses to take a stance, making this one of the many unanswered questions. However, elsewhere in the suttas, there are many indirect statements which seem to amount to the idea that we are ultimately responsible for our fate and for our suffering. For instance, there is the chapter in the Dhammapada on self. There is the fact that there is a path of practice leading to the ending of suffering, and that we are capable of undertaking it.
