# Whether in some sense the path concerns self-search?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems there is no sense in which the path concerns self-search, for an integral part of the path is the perception of not-self in all phenomena, which removes all identification with the five aggregates, six sense bases, elements, and even Nibbāna. Therefore, since the path concerns abandoning the sense of self-completely, there is no sense in which the path concerns self-search.

Objection 2: Even at the earliest stage of the path, stream-entry, self-identity views are completely uprooted, let alone at Arahantship when all sense of conceit, even the slightest, most diffuse construal of "I am", is uprooted; therefore, there is no sense in which the path concerns self-search.

Objection 3: Self-search is characteristic of Brahmanism and other Vedic religions, such as Hinduism, in which union of the self with Higher Self or Brahman is the goal of said religions; however, the Buddha rejects these at (citation).

On the contrary, it is written:

>[The Buddha] “What do you think is better for you: that you search for a woman, or that you search for yourselves?”
>
>“It’s better that we search for ourselves.”

I answer that while an integral part and fruit of the path is the abandonment of all perception of self, insofar as the following not be construed to make any ontological commitment about the actual existence of a self, soul, or other, we may say in many ways that the path concerns self-search. Namely, insofar as the path involves solitude, abandoning external pleasures (i.e., sensual pleasures), developing internal pleasures (i.e., virtue, concentration, wisdom, Nibbāna), focusing internally on the development of the mind, etc., to that extent the path in some sense concerns self-search.
