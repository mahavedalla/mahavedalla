# Whether debate is appropriate to doctrinal study?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems that debate is not appropriate to this science, for the Buddha in many ways criticized debate as being not only unbeneficial but harmful.

Objection 2: Moreover, this science has as its ultimate end Nibbāna, yet debate is beset by many unskillful states, such as divisiveness, conceit, and competitiveness, which must be abandoned for Nibbāna to be realized (AN 10.101??).

On the contrary, the Buddha says various times that both the ability to refute other doctrines and debate are appropriate occasionally. Moreover, our interlocutor, in the spirit of debate, asserts that debate is not appropriate to this science, and thus undermines their own position in the act of asserting it.

I answer that debate, conceived as the mutual exchange of differing opinions about important matters, is appropriate.

Reply to Objection 1: I grant that in many ways the Buddha criticized particular debates and kinds of debate; however, I do not grant that the Buddha criticized debate as such. The Buddha criticized those debates and kinds of debate, such as those wherein the parties are motivated by dogmatism, conceit, competitiveness, bad faith, and other unskillful states, which were deserving of criticism, though he didn't do so one-sidedly. As he said many times, there are occasions where debate is appropriate.

Reply to Objection 2: This objection too fails to distinguish the activity, debate, from the unskillful states. I grant that debate may be often beset by the aforesaid unskillful states, but that doesn't mean debate itself is unskillful, nor that it cannot be practiced without those unskillful states. Views themselves are a basis for those aforesaid unskillful states, yet right view is not unskillful itself, and is actually fundamental to the path. Whatever debate leads to the growth of unskillful states, that debate is inappropriate, and should not be pursued; however, whatever debate leads to the growth of skillful states, that debate is appropriate, and should be pursued. 

Surprisingly, there are suttas where  it is explicitly said of the Buddha that he intended to teach his disciples until the point that they were qualified to refute the doctrines of others:

>‘Wicked One, I shall not be fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teaching. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.' (DN 16; see also Mv.mārayācanakathā SN 35.246; SN 51.10; AN 8.70; UD 51)

This or an equivalent line is repeated enough times throughout the suttas to make it of serious consideration. However, while it expresses that the Buddha intended for his disciples to be able to refute the doctrines of others, it doesn't express explicitly that he sanctioned such refutation in the form of the debate. However, it seems excessive to ask for such explicit warrant. The sutta provides, prima facie, a basis for engaging in debates with outsiders, and thus, a fortiori, other disciples.

Moreover, there are all of the discussions and debates which occurred between the Buddha and outsiders, and his disciples and outsiders. And, in some of those cases, the Buddha explicitly did say that from time to time outsiders should be refuted:

>“Monks, even a monk who has long penetrated the Dhamma in this Doctrine & Discipline would do well periodically & righteously to refute the wanderers of other persuasions in just the way Vajjiya Mahita the householder has done.” (AN 10.94; see also AN 10.93; cf. MN 35, MN 64, )

On the other hand, there are suttas which seem to be critical of debate: suttas which criticize people for concerning themselves solely or specifically with skill in debate to refute others. It seems to me that discussion and debate have their drawbacks, but that nonetheless can form an important part of development on the path and defending the rationality of the Dhamma-Vināya.
