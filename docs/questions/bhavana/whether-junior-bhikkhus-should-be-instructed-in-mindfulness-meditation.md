# Whether junior bhikkhus should be instructed in mindfulness meditation?

<!-- 

Notes:

Notably, it seems the Hillside Hermitage school maintains the negative, or at least that instruction in the four satipaṭṭhānā is not suitable for junior bhikkhus, or something akin to this. This view has been intimated in many of their talks, but is made explicit in the first footnote to their translation of<a href="https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an5.114&search=junior&pali=hide#an5.114:0.1_an5.114:4.1" target="_blank" rel="noopender noreferrer">AN 5.114<a>. Bhante Anīgha cites SN 47.3, SN 47.15, and SN 47.16 in support of this position, but neglects to mention SN 47.4, which explicitly contradicts the view:

>Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are newly ordained, not long gone forth, recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline, should be exhorted,settled, and established by you in the development of the four establishments of mindfulness. What four?

Granted, it may well be there is some non ad hoc interpretation of this sutta which doesn't entail a strict contradiction, though no such interpretation has been presented. It might just be granted that the sutta means what it says, but the scope is limited, or that, in light of overwhelming evidence elsewhere in the Canon that the satipaṭṭhānā follow, not precede, right view. However, such evidence has not been explicitly offered.
