# Whether sorrow is an appropriate response to the suffering of others?

## Bibliography

Notes:

I've seen various theists and theologians, in discussing the afterlife, universalism, annihilationism, etc., mention how sorrow, or sadness, or grief, are the appropriate emotions in response to the suffering of others. Paraphrasing, e.g., grief would be appropriate if one knew that loved ones were in hell for eternity, and thus heaven couldn't constitute perfect bliss if one knew there loved ones were damned. My main curiosity is with the claim that some form of negative emotion, some form of personal suffering, is actually appropriate in certain circumstances, such as knowledge of the suffering of others. 

At face value, it would seem the Buddhist is going to have to deny this. Why? There are a few ways this can be seen. The Buddhist probably wants to affirm the Buddha was free from suffering while living following his awakening and that he was well aware, in fact far more so than anyone else, of the suffering and plight of living beings. Moreover, I don't think the Buddhist wants to say the Buddha was numb, psychopathic, or in some way affectively dysfunctional, such that he wasn't feeling what he should have been felt, i.e., sorrow or grief. Taken together, it looks like we're going to want to say that some form of suffering is not an appropriate response to the suffering of others. And the following is a very rough sketch, but the whole project of Buddhism is to end suffering, and it seems like what underlies this assumption is that all suffering is really gratuitous, a disease, a cancer, and has no place in experience. But then it looks like we'd want to say that nor does it have a place in our response to anything, let alone the suffering of others.
