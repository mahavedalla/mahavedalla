# Whether higher doctrine is a practical science?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems this science is not practical, for its primary aim is to systematically and philosophically exposit the doctrine, which is intellectual; therefore, this science is not practical, but intellectual.

Reply to Objection 1: This objection fails to distinguish between provisional and ultimate aims. While this science has as its provisional aim the systematic and philosophical exposition of doctrine, its ultimate aim, that which the latter is directed towards, is Nibbāna. Moreover, this objection fails to consider that what is intellectual is practical in two ways. (1) The practice of the path is determined by the intellectual views that the practitioner adopts. (2) Truth, in itself, is a good and part of the path and goal, and the use of the intellect, among other rational faculties, seems indispensable to knowledge of the truth.
