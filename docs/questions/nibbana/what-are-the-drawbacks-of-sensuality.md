# What are the drawbacks of sensuality?

There are at least five distinct, though related, classes of drawbacks of sensuality:
(1) Mental drawbacks (i.e., sensuality causes suffering)
(2) Obstructive drawbacks (i.e., sensuality is an obstruction to the development of the path and superior pleasures)
(3) Ethical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality impairs the faculty of judgement, which results in unethical behavior)
(4) Aesthetic drawbacks (i.e., most sensual pleasures have gross aspects)
(5) Practical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality involves time and sensual pleasures cost money which are better spent elsewhere)

Let us examine each class and its constituents in turn.

(1) Mental drawbacks

The foremost drawback of sensuality is that it causes suffering to those afflicted by it. This suffering can be divided into two distinct, though related, types: (1) the inevitable suffering that results when one's sensual craving is frustrated; (2) the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving.

(2) Obstructive drawbacks

(3) Ethical drawbacks

(4) Aesthetic drawbacks

(5) Practical drawbacks

Notes:

I am uncertain whether or not to discuss sensuality, or sensual craving, and if there is even any meaningful distinction. -->
