# Whether this science is concerned with expounding a Buddhist philosophy or worldview?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

The question addresses a subtle distinction. Is this science fundamentally concerned with expounding a worldview, philosophy, or theory of everything, or theory of reality, through a Buddhist lens? (This I take to be a more external approach. This takes the basic concern to be worldviews, and then addresses this through Buddhism.) Or, is it concerned with expounding Buddhist doctrine and discipline on its own terms? This I take to be more faithful to my aims, since this aligns the aims of the science with Buddhist doctrines, as opposed to beginning from the aim of worldviews, and then importing Buddhism. Thus, this science is concerned with fleshing out Buddhist doctrine in itself, and for the sake of a perspicuous doctrine, for the sake of Nibbāna. It is not concerned with designing a coherent or systematic worldview in itself. However, this distinction I imagine will be lost in practice, for expouding Buddhist doctrine will, so I think as of now, involve claims about reality, and so will inadvertently fulfill the aims of the other method in question.
