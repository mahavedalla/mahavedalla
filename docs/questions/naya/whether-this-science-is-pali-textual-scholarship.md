# Whether this science is Pāli textual scholarship?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

I do not consider this science to be Pāli textual scholarship. It seems to me Pāli scholarship is linguistic and philological. I do not doubt that many great Pāli scholars were also Buddhist scholars, and maybe other kinds of scholars, yet the concern is with Pāli scholarship itself. As a linguistic discipline, Pāli scholarship is concerned fundamentally with linguistic questions, and Pāli texts as pieces of writing. This science is concerned provisionally with doctrine, and ultimately with Nibbāna. It can certainly benefit very much from Pāli scholarship, but the two are not identical. Their aims are differnent. Their outputs different. Their methods different. Their perspectives different.
