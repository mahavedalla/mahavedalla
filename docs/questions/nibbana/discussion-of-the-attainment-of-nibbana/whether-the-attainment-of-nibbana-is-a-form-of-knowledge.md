Notes:

"abhiññāya kho ahaṃ, uttiya, sāvakānaṃ dhammaṃ desemi sattānaṃ visuddhiyā sokaparidevānaṃ samatikkamāya dukkhadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamāya ñāyassa adhigamāya nibbānassa sacchikiriyāyā" (AN 10.95)

Pariñña is also defined exactly as the Nibbāna is in certain places: namely, the destruction of the defilments.

It seems to me that in some contexts "knowledge" implies experience in the sense of having undergone—e.g., "I know what that is like"—not knowledge in a strict philosophical sense—e.g., Gettier aside, true justified belief, or a truth-tracking belief, etc. I have a sense this applies to the Canon as well at times. Thus, the question is raised, is Nibbāna directly known in the sense of being experienced in the sense of being attained, undergone, reached, etc., as opposed to say being an object of knowledge in the sense of epistemic knowledge?
