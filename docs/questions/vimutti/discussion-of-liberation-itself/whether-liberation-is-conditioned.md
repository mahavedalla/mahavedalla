# Whether liberation is conditioned?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Right liberation is not infrequently discussed in the suttas as part of an extended noble path, for instance in the tenfold paths. This includes the eightfold path, but  adds right liberation and right knowledge and vision of liberation. There seems to be clear evidence that the noble eightfold path is conditioned. By analogy, we might think that these extended paths are also conditioned; and, since they include liberation, that liberation too is conditioned. Whether or not this is right, I don't yet know. There are also other suttas which discuss liberation as being conditioned and a conditioner. Yet again, there is a sutta which defines liberation as liberation from the defilements. If it is thought this is identical to Nibbāna, then it would seem it isn't conditioned.

However, it is worth noting that at this stage it hasn't be clarified whether (1) liberation has a univocal meaning in the suttas, and (2) there are different types of conditionality. I'm confident that (2) is true. I haven't investigated (1) thoroughly, but I am inclined to think that liberation has multiple meanings or referents in the suttas. Thus, regarding (1), clearly distinguishing those meanings would be necessary to proceed with any analysis of this question. Regarding (2), the conditioning of interest in this question is existential and causal conditionality: i.e., one thing's existence depending on another, or one thing being caused by another. This is distinct from, say, conditional attainability: i.e., certain things leading to another, like the path leads to Nibbāna, or a stream leads to a river.

Doug's Dharma discusses this tangentially in his video on Dr. Gombrich's controversial thesis that the brahmaviharas themselves can lead to Nibbāna.
