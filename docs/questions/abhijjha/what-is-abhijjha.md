“Abhijjhā” can be translated as covetousness, that is, the desire for what belongs to others, for it is said: 

Idha, gahapatayo, ekacco abhijjhālu hoti, yaṁ taṁ parassa paravittūpakaraṇaṁ taṁ abhijjhātā hoti: ‘aho vata yaṁ parassa taṁ mamassā’ti. ([MN 41](https://suttacentral.net/mn41/pli/ms?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin))

Here someone is covetous; he covets the wealth and property of others thus: ‘Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!’ ([MN 41](https://suttacentral.net/mn41/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false))
