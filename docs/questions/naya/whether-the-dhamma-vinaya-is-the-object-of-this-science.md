# Whether the Dhamma-Vināya is the object of this science?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection 1: It seems the Dhamma-Vināya are not the object of this science, for this science employs foreign methods to infer conclusions not found in the Dhamma-Vināya of the Canon; therefore, the Dhamma-Vināya are not the object of this science.

Reply to Objection 1: This objection fails to distinguish between the Dhamma-Vināya as the truth of reality itself, and as expressed in the Canon. The former is inexhaustible, while the latter is finite, limited by material resources, time, and the functions of beings, and therefore does not capture the former in its entirety. Therefore, this science uses foreign methods to infer conclusions not found in the Dhamma-Vināya of the Canon about the Dhamma-Vināya as the truth of reality. Nonetheless, the Dhamma-Vināya of the Canon is too the object of this science.
