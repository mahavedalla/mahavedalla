# Whether attachment to desire, not merely desire, is the cause of suffering?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

Objection: It seems that it is attachment to desire, not merely desire, which causes suffering, since activities like desire to eat, walk, sleep, and talk, etc., are not in themselves the cause of suffering, for it is said that the Arahant continues to engage in these activities; rather, it is the attachment, addiction, and clinging, etc., to these very desires which causes suffering.

On the contrary, it is written that the Teacher taught for the sake of the removal of desire (and lust) for the five aggregates, and this for two reasons: (1) the drawback that insofar as there is desire for the five aggregates, there is suffering when those aggregates undergo some change or alteration; (2) the benefit that insofar as there is no such desire, there is no such suffering. And this could only be because desire itself is culpable, not some particular relation thereto.
