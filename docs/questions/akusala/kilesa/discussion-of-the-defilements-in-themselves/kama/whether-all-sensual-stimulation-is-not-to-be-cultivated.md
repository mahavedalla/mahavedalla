# Whether all sensual stimulation is not to be cultivated?

<!-- 

Notes:

The question here more or less arises in response to the fact that the Buddha and his disciples did continue to eat fine foods and enjoy the pleasures of nature, among other things, after their awakening. I use sensual stimulation to refer to the pleasure of objects of the senses, distinct from the object itself, and yet also from the delight, intoxication, etc., which arise on account of sensual craving. Below I make a fourfold distinction.

1. Sensual object
2. Pleasure of sensual object
3. Delight, intoxication, etc., from gratifying sensual craving with pleasure of sensual object
4. Sensual craving

This contrasts with a more common twofold distinction made in the Canon and elsewhere simply between craving and sensual objects. We know the Arahant continues to be sensitive to pleasure and pain, and thus this seems to indicate he is still sensitive to, say, the pleasure of a pleasant meal, or pleasant sight, or agreeable touch, such as of nice robes. Thus, when walking by a beautiful sunset, for instance, he doesn't merely experience it or come into contact with it with complete neutrality, but he might experience it as pleasant. Thus there is the distinction between 1 and 2. While we want to say the Arahant is sensitive to pleasure in some sense, I don't think we want to affirm that they are sensitive to anything like the pleasure that the ordinary person would experience when indulging in their senses. So, the distinction between 2 and 3. Moreover, that pleasure of the ordinary person seems to be connected with craving though not identical to it. Maybe it is a mode or property or function of craving. So, 3 and 4.
