It is the conjunction of \"mah\u0101\", meaning great, and \"vedalla\", which literally means \"to be split apart\", but has the sense of \"question and answer\" or \"catechism\"; and thus, \"Mah\u0101vedalla\" is naturally rendered as \"The Great Q&amp;A\".</p> <p>Q: What is the Mah\u0101vedalla project?</p> <p>The Mah\u0101vedalla project is dedicated to systematically asking and answering, as far as is possible, every and all relevant questions about the doctrine and discipline of the P\u0101li Canon, particularly the Nik\u0101yas, Vin\u0101ya, and the other early texts therein. It does so in a question and answer, or catechetical, format.</p> <p>Q: What is the purpose of the Mah\u0101vedalla?</p> <p>The primary purpose of the Mah\u0101vedalla project is to provide convenient access to information about the doctrine and discipline of the P\u0101li Canon for all those who are interested, at any stage in their understanding. This ought to be especially useful as an instruction manual or catechism for those unfamiliar with the Canon (new practitioners or non-Buddhists looking to learn more). It also ought to be useful for those who are familiar but who lack a convenient, organized, and concise repository of information about the Canon for reference.</p> <p>Q: How did the Mah\u0101vedalla begin?</p> <p>This project began as more or less a personal repository for the author to record the questions and subsequent answers that arose for them in their study of the Canon, in their attempt to flesh out and penetrate its contents. </p> <p>Q: What is unique about the Mah\u0101vedalla?</p>"},{"location":"other/methodology/","title":"Methodology","text":""},{"location":"other/methodology/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>At present, entries are written in a highly standardized and organized format to improve clarity and readability (at the expense of enjoyability), as well as to lighten the task of future translation, if it is ever undertaken</p>"},{"location":"other/support/","title":"Support","text":""},{"location":"other/support/#how-to-support-the-mahavedalla-project","title":"How to support the Mah\u0101vedalla project.","text":"<p>(1) Asking Questions: Asking questions relevant to the doctrine and discipline of the Canon that are not yet in the project.</p> <p>(2) Curation: vetting, revising, updating, etc., answers to questions.</p> <p>(3) Answering Questions: answering unanswered questions in the project.</p> <p>(4) Metadata: adding metadata to questions     - Sutta references, commentarial references, Dhamma talks, articles, books, etc..</p> <p>(5) Translation: translating entries into whatever non-English language you are literate in.</p> <p>(6) Development: Upgrading and expanding the digital format of the Mah\u0101vedalla     - iOS and Android app     - Smart search system     - making a PDF         - making an introduction to dhammavinaya/catechism using part of the project</p> <p>(7) Other: anything else which might be useful</p>"},{"location":"questions/nibbana/what-are-the-drawbacks-of-sensuality/","title":"What are the drawbacks of sensuality?","text":"<p>There are at least five distinct, though related, classes of drawbacks of sensuality: (1) Mental drawbacks (i.e., sensuality causes suffering) (2) Obstructive drawbacks (i.e., sensuality is an obstruction to the development of the path and superior pleasures) (3) Ethical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality impairs the faculty of judgement, which results in unethical behavior) (4) Aesthetic drawbacks (i.e., most sensual pleasures have gross aspects) (5) Practical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality involves time and sensual pleasures cost money which are better spent elsewhere)</p> <p>Let us examine each class and its constituents in turn.</p> <p>(1) Mental drawbacks</p> <p>The foremost drawback of sensuality is that it causes suffering to those afflicted by it.
