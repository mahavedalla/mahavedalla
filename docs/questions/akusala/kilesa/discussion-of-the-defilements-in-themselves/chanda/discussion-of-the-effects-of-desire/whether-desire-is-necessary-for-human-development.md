Notes:

Objection: It seems that desire is necessary for human development, for if there were no desire whatsoever, who would work, strive, and exert energy to build buildings, cure diseases, end world hunger, expand digital resources, etc.?

On the contrary...

I answer that this objection (1) equivocates between two meanings of the word "desire" and (2) presupposes a value structure not present in the discipline of the Noble Ones. Regarding (1), the ending of "desire" with respect to the goal of the holy life is the ending of craving, not of inclinations of will or values, the latter being what is necessary for human development. Therefore, we can say even someone who is desireless has certain values, such as the welfare of all living beings, and in that sense still has "desires". Regarding (2), this objection presupposes that human development, in the sense of material development, is the foremost human value; however, material development is at best a handmaiden, an instrument, to human welfare and happiness; and therefore, where it competes with that value, it loses. Therefore, since desirelessness constitutes the highest human welfare and happiness, it takes precedence over human development, even if that results in materially inferior condition.
