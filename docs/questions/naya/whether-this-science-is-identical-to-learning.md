# Whether this science is identical to learning?

## Bibliography

<!-- 

Notes:

As I intend this science, it is not identical to learning. While I do not think this term is satisfactory, I will use it for now: I take learning to be passive, while this science is active, in that it seeks to construct, detail, etc., a systematic doctrine. Learning is the reading, memorizing, reciting, while this science is productive. The two are interrelated in that learning is the bedrock of any systematic doctrine, and systematic doctrine employs learning to its end.
