# What is learning?

## Introduction

According to the Canon, "learning" refers to the learning of the Dhamma teachings, in their various kinds, taught by the Buddha. For it is frequently said:

>Here, monks, a certain person learns the Dhamma—the discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and questions-and-answers..." (AN 4.102, author's translation; cf. AN 4.102; Cf. AN 4.103; AN 4.107; AN 4.108; AN 4.186; AN 4.191; AN 4.192; AN 5.73; AN 5.74; AN 5.75; AN 5.155; italics added)

## 1. Words for learning

There are at least three words found in the Canon relevant to the discussion of learning: 
1. "pariyatti" and its cognate verb "pariyāpuṇāti"
2. "suta" and "bahussuta"
3. "sutavant"

Let us examine each in turn.

### 1.1 "pariyatti"

"pariyatti", the cognate noun of "pariyāpuṇāti" literally means mastery. In regards to learning, it doesn't simply connote learning, or someone who learns, or study, but mastery, or learnedness, or scholarship. "pariyāpuṇāti" is most often used in a refrain in the Canon (cf. [Introduction](#h2-introduction)) to describe someone who is learned in the Dhamma teachings of the Buddha.

### 1.2 "suta" and "bahussuta"

AN 4.186

<!-- 

Notes:

This rather simple subject is actually somewhat challenging. There are other words in the Canon which are relevent besides pariyatti, like suta. It seems to me also that pariyatti is not just learning, but learnedness, or scholarship, that is to say, it is learning well or becoming learned of the Dhamma teachings, mastering them. 

An attempt at Pali:

"Learning" in the Canon is the learning of the Dhamma teachings taught by the Buddha. For it is frequently said:

"Suta"ti pāliyaṃ buddhena desitānaṃ dhammadesanānāṃ sutaṃ hoti. Evamhi bahulaṃ vuttaṃ: 
idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo dhammaṃ <i>pariyāpuṇāti</i> – suttaṃ, geyyaṃ, veyyākaraṇaṃ, gāthaṃ, udānaṃ, itivuttakaṃ, jātakaṃ, abbhutadhammaṃ, vedallaṃ.
