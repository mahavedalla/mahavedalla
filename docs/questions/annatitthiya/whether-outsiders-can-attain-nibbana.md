# Whether outsiders can attain Nibbāna?

<!-- 

Notes:

An outsider is someone who is not a disciple of the Buddha, and is thus "outside" of Buddhism. Thus, a typical Christian, Hindu, or secular person, is an outsider. There is a question about whether one can be inside and outside, so to speak. Moreover, there is a question about whether or not an outsider could hold the same doctrine and discipline as the Buddha, or if by definition outsiders do not.

This question should be distinguished from this question: Whether an outsider has attained Nibbāna? The latter deals with matters of fact, whereas this question is concerned with possibility. Thus it might be that no outsider has actually attained Nibbāna, though it nonetheless could be done.

As far as I am aware, the suttas do not directly answer this exact question, though it seems that an answer can be inferred from various passages which treat it indirectly. For instance, the Buddha was asked directly whether any of the six sectarian teachers of his time had direct knowledge. This question concerns a specific set of people, not people in general, and direct knowledge (abhiññā), not Nibbāna specifically. Regarding the latter point, I assume for now that direct knowledge and the attainment of Nibbāna are at least mutually entailed; thus, if one has direct knowledgge, one has attained Nibbāna, and if one has attained Nibbāna, one has direct knowledge. This might be incorrect.

According to Ajaan Geoff, in his treatise <i>Skill in Questions: How the Buddha Taught</i>:

>...it is clear that, from the Buddha’s point of view, there are no awakened teachers outside of his dispensation...

I assume this means or entails that there are no awakened beings outside of the Buddha's dispensation, not just teachers; and thus there are no awakened outsiders; and thus no outsiders who have attained Nibbāna (taking awakening and the attainment of Nibbāna to be at least mutually entailed). If this interpretation is correct, this answers the question of whether an outsider has attained Nibbāna. However, the suttas he cites in support of this interpretation seem to suggest more. Why? 

>“Furthermore, the monk who is a learner [one who has attained any of the first three levels of awakening] reflects, ‘Is there outside of this [Dhamma & Vinaya] any contemplative or brahman who teaches the true, genuine, & accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One?’ And he discerns, ‘No, there is no contemplative or brahman outside of this [Dhamma & Vinaya] who teaches the true, genuine, & accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One.’”

The sutta describes this knowledge without respect to time, place, or other circumstances. It may very well be that the sutta has in mind the learner reflecting on this in the Buddha's day. However, if it is interpreted as applying to learners per se, then it seems to provide more solid grounds for an answer to the question of this article. If any learner knows upon reflection that there is no outsider who teaches a true doctrine and discipline, then this seems to imply that it just could not be that an outsider could teach a true doctrine and discipline. Assuming teaching a true doctrine and discipline and the attainment of Nibbāna are mutually entailed, then there could not be an outsider who has attained Nibbāna.

>yasmiṃ kho, subhadda, dhammavinaye ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo na upalabbhati, samaṇopi tattha na upalabbhati. dutiyopi tattha
 samaṇo na upalabbhati. tatiyopi tattha samaṇo na upalabbhati. catutthopi tattha samaṇo na upalabbhati. yasmiñca kho, subhadda, dhammavinaye ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo upalabbhati, samaṇopi tattha upalabbhati, dutiyopi tattha samaṇo upalabbhati, tatiyopi tattha samaṇo upalabbhati, catutthopi tattha samaṇo upalabbhati.

>O Subhadda, in which doctrine and discipline the noble eightfold path is not found, neither is a monk found there, nor is a second monk found there, nor is a third monk found there, nor is a fourth monk found there. But, Subhadda, in which doctrine and discipline the noble eightfold path is found, a monk is found there too, and a second monk is found there, and a third monk is found there, and a fourth monk is found there.
