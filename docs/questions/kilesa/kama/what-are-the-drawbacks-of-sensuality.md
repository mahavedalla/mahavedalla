# What are the drawbacks of sensuality?

## Introduction

There are at least five distinct, though related, families of drawbacks of sensuality:
1. Mental drawbacks (i.e., sensuality causes suffering)
2. Obstructive drawbacks (i.e., sensuality is an obstruction to the development of the path and superior pleasures)
3. Ethical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality impairs the faculty of judgement, which results in unethical behavior)
4. Aesthetic drawbacks (i.e., most sensual pleasures have gross aspects)
5. Practical drawbacks (i.e., sensuality involves time and sensual pleasures cost money which are better spent elsewhere)

Let us examine each family and its constituents in turn.

## 1. Mental Drawbacks

The foremost drawback of sensuality is that it causes suffering to those afflicted by it. This drawback can be divided into three distinct, though related, drawbacks: (1.1) the inevitable suffering that results when sensual craving is frustrated; (1.2) the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving; (1.3) the unsatisfactoriness of sensual pleasures.

Let us examine each in turn.

<i>1\.1  The suffering of frustrated sensual craving</i>

The first mental drawback of sensuality is the suffering of frustrated sensual craving. Inevitably, for those afflicted by sensual craving, suffering, in various different forms—e.g., dissatisfaction, sorrow, grief, anger, anxiety—will arise when their sensual craving is frustrated, that is, for whatever reason, not satisfied. This commonly occurs when one's access to the objects of their sensual craving is frustrated; for instance, when one loses a loved one to death, or one's most precious possessions are stolen or destroyed, or they eat food that disagrees with them, or, inevitably, one must face death, and thus separation from all that is beloved to them. For, in SN 22.2, it is said:

>"There are, friends, wise khattiyas, wise brahmins, wise househoulders, and wise ascetics who question a bhikkhu when he has gone abroad—for wise people, friends, are inquisitive: 'What does your teacher say, what does he teach?' Being asked thus, friends, you should answer: 'Our teacher, friends, teaches the removal of desire and lust.'\
"When you have answered thus, friends, there may be wise khattiyas ... wise ascetics who will question you further—for wise people, friends, are inquisitive: 'In regard to what does your teacher teach the removal of desire and lust?' Being asked thus, friends, you should answer: 'Our teacher, friends, teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness.'\
"When you have answered thus, friends, there may be wise khattiyas, wise ascetics who will question you further—for wise people, friends, are inquisitve: 'Having seen what danger does your teacher teach the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness?' Being asked thus, friends, you should answer thus: 'If, friends, one is not devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving in regard to form, then with the change and alteration of form there arise in one sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. If, friends, one is not devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving in regard to feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, then with the change and alteration of consciousness there arise in one sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Having seen this danger, our teacher teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness.'

However, on the other hand, for those unafflicted by sensual craving, suffering, to that extent, will not arise. For, the same discourse continues:

>If one is devoid of lust, desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving in regarding to feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, then with the change and alteration of consciousness sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair do not arise in one. Having seen this benefit, our teacher teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, the removal of desire and lust for feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness.' (SN 22.??)<!-- citation -->
<!-- more suttas which discuss this such as MN 87 -->

Thus, the first mental drawback of sensual craving is the suffering of frustrated sensual craving.

### 1.2 The suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving

The second mental drawback of sensuality is the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving. According to the Canon, sensual craving is a disease of the mind as leprosy is a disease to the body. Namely, sensual craving overwhelms the mind with dissatisfaction, and consequently various secondary forms of suffering—e.g.,sorrow, grief, anger, anxiety—that then must be appeased, though not uprooted, through indulgence in the objects the sensual craving directs, as if through coercion, the mind towards. Appeasing this sensual craving by indulging it results in a measure of gratification (largely just relief from the craving itself), though sensual craving remains fundamentally suffering, a disease of mind. Moreover, it is often this appeasement that that excacerbates the sensual craving itself, nor can it actually uproot or eliminate the craving. For, in MN 75 it is said:

>"Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit. What do you think, Māgandiya? Would that man twist his body this way and that?"
>
>"Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, hot, and scorching."
"What do you think, Māgandiya? Is it only now that that fire is painful to touch, hot, and scorching, or previously too was that fire painful to touch, hot, and scorching?"
>
>"Master Gotama, that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching. For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching
the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired; thus, though the fire was actually painful to touch, he acquired a mistaken perception
of it as pleasant."
>
>"So too, Māgandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch, hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and
scorching. But these beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant." 
>
>"Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal pit; the more he scratches the scabs and cauterises his body, the fouler, more evil-smelling and more infected the openings of his wounds would become, yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of his wounds. So too, Māgandiya, beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, still indulge in sensual pleasures; the more such beings indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned by their fever for sensual pleasures, yet they find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasure."<!-- Let it be noted here that I should hope to proceed with more questions and back and forth on this particular issue. -->

This example in particular illustrates the Buddha's mastery of the use of simile.

Thus, the second mental drawback of sensual craving is the suffering inherent in the experience of sensual craving.

<i>1.3 The unsatisfactoriness of sensual pleasures</i>
 
 The third mental drawback of sensual craving is the unsatisfactoriness of sensual pleasures. Despite their often irresistible seductive charm, sensual pleasures afford a trifling and ephemeral gratification that doesn't ultimately satisfy.<!-- AN 10.46 -->

Notes:

I am uncertain whether or not to discuss sensuality, or sensual craving, and if there is even any meaningful distinction.

Thought: sensual happiness is mediated; an unmediated happiness is more desirable
