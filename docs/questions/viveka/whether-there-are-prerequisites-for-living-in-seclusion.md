# Whether there are prerequisites for living in seclusion?

## Introduction

"Living in seclusion" is assumed in this article to mean "qualified for living in seclusion". According to the Canon, there are at least eight related prerequisites for living in seclusion:
1. Renunciate thoughts
2. Thought free from ill-will
3. Non-cruel thoughts
4. Wisdom
5. The noble aggregate of virtue
6. Noble sense-restraint
7. Noble mindfulness and clear comprehension
8. Samādhi
9. Non-delight in company

Let us examine each in turn.

## 1. Thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will, non-cruelty, and with wisdom

It should first be noted that this section will describe a list of necessary and sufficient conditions for living in seclusion, which to some extent obviates the need for discussion of further prerequisites in subsequent sections. Nonetheless, the inclusion of further discussion of other relevant discourses which comment differently on this matter will allow for a fuller understanding thereof. 

The first four prerequisites for living in seclusion are endowment with thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will, non-cruelty, and with wisdom. At AN 4.262 it is said that a monk endowed "with thoughts of sensuality, with thoughts of ill will, with thoughts of harmfulness" and who is "a person of weak discernment... isn't fit to stay in isolated forest & wilderness dwellings." However, a monk endowed "with thoughts of renunciation, with thoughts of non-ill will, with thoughts of harmlessness" and who "is a discerning person... is fit to stay in isolated forest & wilderness dwellings" ([AN 4.262, trans. Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu](#bibliography); cf. DN 2; MN 4; MN 27; MN 38; MN 94; MN 101; AN 4.198). 

If it is assumed that the four latter and four former qualities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive[^1], then this discourse provides a list of both necessary and sufficient conditions for living in seclusion[^2].

## 2. The noble aggregate of virtue, noble sense-restraint, and noble mindfulness and clear comprehension

The fifth, sixth, and seventh prerequisites for living in seclusion which are oft repeatedly implied in the Canonical description of the gradual training are the noble aggregate of moral discipline, noble sense-restraint, and noble virtue, respectively. For it is said:

> Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded dwelling—a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. ([DN 2, trans. Bhikkhu Bodhi](#bibliography)) <!-- other discourses? -->

While this discourse doesn't explicitly state thus, it clearly implies that once one is endowed with the noble aggregate of virtue, noble sense-restraint, and noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, they are qualified to live in seclusion. It seems that these latter qualities are implied by the attainment of the qualities discussed in [§1](#1-thoughts-of-renunciation-non-ill-will-non-cruelty-and-with-wisdom); that is to say, endowment with thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will, non-cruelty, and with wisdom necessitate, at least generally among Buddhist disciples, endowment with virtue, sense-restraint, and mindfulness and clear comprehension. For, one without virtue, sense-restraint, mindfulness and clear comprehension does not attain purity of thought.

## 3. Samādhi

The eighth prerequisite for living in seclusion implied by the Canon is samādhi. For it is said:

>“Upāli, it’s not easy to endure isolated wilderness & forest lodgings. It’s not easy to maintain seclusion, not easy to enjoy being alone. The forests, as it were, plunder the mind of a monk who has not gained concentration. Whoever would say, ‘I, without having gained concentration, will spend time in isolated wilderness & forest lodgings,’ of him it can be expected that he will sink to the bottom or float away. ([AN 10.99, trans. Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu](#bibliography); cf. MN 4)

This discourse implies that samādhi is a necessary condition for living in seclusion, though not that it is a sufficient condition.

## 4. Non-delight in solitude

The ninth prerequisite for living in seclusion implied by the Canon is non-delight in company. For it is said:

>Mendicants, it is quite impossible that a mendicant who enjoys company and groups, who loves them and likes to enjoy them, should take pleasure in being alone in seclusion....It’s quite possible that a mendicant who doesn’t enjoy company and groups, who doesn’t love them and like to enjoy them, should take pleasure in being alone in seclusion. ([AN 6.68, trans. Bhikkhu Sujato](#bibliography))

It is unclear the position of taking pleasure in solitude in being qualified to live in solitude. It seems prima facie permissible to assume it is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition.

<!-- ## Notes -->

[^1]: It is convenient to assume thus, though it also seems plausible that this is not the case. For instance, it might seem that endowment with "thoughts of sensuality" and "thoughts of renunciation" are not mutually exclusive, for it seems a monk (or anyone) could be endowed with a mixture of both.

[^2]: It must be acknowledged that without further context, this discourse may have been originally directed towards a particular audience, and thus might not be readily generalizable.
