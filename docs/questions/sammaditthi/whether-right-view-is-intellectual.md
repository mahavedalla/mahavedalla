# Whether right view is intellectual?

<!-- 

Notes:

I currently do not think right view is intellectual, but is something more experiential or intuitive, though I haven't exactly clarified what it is. There are pretty clear indications in the suttas that it is not a kind of intellectual knowledge in the sense of assenting to the right propositions and doctrines alone. However, while I do not think right view itself is intellectual, it nonetheless seems like is inseparable from intellectual doctrines. That is basically to say that one with right view, who knows directly that craving is the cause of suffering, knows that intellectually as well, at least under ordinary circumstances. To teach, preach, discuss, etc., about the Dhamma seems to necessitate a working intellectual view. So it seems that right view has a kind of intellectual counterpart or entails some kind of intellectual understanding.
