It seems to me that the question of questions, that is, what questions should be answered and how, is fundamental both to the practice and the object of this particular project, which is to answer questions. That the Buddha meant his word when he delivered AN 4.42 is evidenced by his consistent application of the advice therein throughout the Canon (MN 63; MN 72; AN 10.95). As is suggested in the Pañha Sutta, the questions one asks are indications of what one takes to be worthwhile. Given that, according to the Buddha, what is ultimately worthwhile is the end of suffering, it was appropriate that he dismiss those questions which were detrimental or contrary to that aim. Why? Since such questions would have been founded in taking that as worthwhile which was contrary to what is actually worthwhile, according to the Buddha, by engaging such questions the Buddha would have been reinforcing misguided values and leading his questioners astray. 

     For those of us interested in Buddhism as a practice, not merely as an intellectual subject, it thus seems fitting that we apply such a framework for viewing questions to ourselves. Given that this project has been undertaken from the perspective of practice, such a framework will also be applied to it.
