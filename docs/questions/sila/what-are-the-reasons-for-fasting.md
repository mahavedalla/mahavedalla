# What are the reasons for fasting?

## Introduction

There are three families of reasons for fasting:
1. Spiritual
2. Physical
3. Practical
4. Conventional

Let us examine each family in turn.

## 1. Spiritual reasons for fasting

One of the foremost reasons for undertaking a practice of fasting is that, under the proper direction and within the limits of good health, it can be used as a skillful means to attenuate gustatory craving and to develop skillful virtues in its stead. For it is said:

## 2. Physical reasons for fasting

The second reason for fasting is physical. Albeit less noble, fasting can improve the health and vitality of one fit to undertake it. The Buddha himself describes three different physical reasons for undertaking a regular practice of fasting: 
1. Improved immunity to illness
2. Greater lightness of body 
3. Increased energy

## 3. Practical

The third reason for fasting is practical. The consumption of food generally costs time and energy in planning, preparing, eating, and cleaning up after the meal. By fasting, time can be divested from these activities to more productive ones, such as meditation, study, work, service to others, etc..

## 4. Conventional

The fourth reason for fasting is conventional. This particular reason does not so much apply generally, but to samaṇas. In ancient India during the life of the Buddha, it was customary and expected that samaṇas would, in virtue of their status as samaṇas, refrain from eating at the wrong time of roughly after midday until dawn, and thus fast. Respect for this ancient convention is thus another reason for samaṇas in particular, though all those who appreciate it, to fast regularly.
