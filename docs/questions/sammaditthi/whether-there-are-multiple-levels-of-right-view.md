# Whether there are multiple levels of right view?

## Introduction

According the the Canon, three kinds of right view are explicitly recognized, while one is implied. In order of level on the path:
1. Mundane right view
2. Transcendent right view
3. Final right view
4. The right view of one beyond training

## Commentary

It should first be noted that in listing these levels of right view, this is not in itself a commitment to their actually being distinct, for it could be argued some of the forms are identical, just receiving different names in different places. Nonetheless, it will be maintained that these forms are distinct, in the sense that they are not identical, while they remain highly interrelated (mundane right view begets transcendent right view, which begets final right view, etc.).

In his treatise [<i>On the Path</i>](#bibliography) Ajaan Geoff (2017) lists three kinds of right view in the Pāli Canon:

>When the texts define conviction, they frame it as a matter of having conviction in the Buddha’s awakening (§55). In fact, the three levels of right view follow the pattern of the Buddha’s three knowledges on the night of his awakening (§30): Mundane right view accepts the content of the first two knowledges, on kamma and rebirth. Transcendent right view accepts the third knowledge, in which the Buddha’s discovery of the four noble truths led to his awakening. The final level of right view, which lies beyond the transcendent, accepts a step that isn’t mentioned in the standard description of the third knowledge, but which the Buddha elsewhere states was a crucial stage on the path: the total abandoning of the path itself. (pp. 113)

However, I do not recall him claiming that this list is exhaustive; therefore, that an additional form of right view is included here does not in itself conflict with Ajaan Geoff's view as expressed above. Moreover, elsewhere he has intimated that the right of one beyond training is distinct from the other forms of right view. It seems clear the final level of right view he describes pertains to the moments preceding the attainment of Arahantship:

>The final level of right view represents the stage when the path has done its work and the duties of the four noble truths collapse into one: Everything is to be regarded with dispassion and let go. (pp. 140)

The canon infrequently, however, mentions one more level of right view: the right view of one beyond training (asekhā sammadiṭṭhi).
